<p>Deep learning refers to artificial neural networks (a set of feature learning models)
 which consist of multiple layers.
Different layers learn different levels of abstractions (or features) of the raw input data.</p>
<p>Some people think it is a rebranding neural networks developed twenty years ago, since it inherits many key neural networks and algorithms. However, deep learning exploits the fact that high-level abstractions are
better at representing the data than raw, hand-crafted features, thus achieving better performance
in learning. Its recent resurgence is mainly fuelled by higher than ever accuracy obtained in image
recognition.</p>
<h1>Why now?</h1>
<h2>Computation power</h2>
<h2>massive training data</h2>
<h2>algorithm breakthrough and advances of neural net structures</h2>
<p>It's a growing trend in ML due to some favorable results in applications where the target function is very complex and the datasets are large. For example in Hinton et al. (2012),  Hinton and his students managed to beat the status quo prediction systems on five well known datasets: Reuters, TIMIT, MNIST, CIFAR and ImageNet. This covers speech, text and image classification - and these are quite mature datasets, so a win on any of these gets some attention. A win on all of them gets a lot of attention.</p>
<p>"Deep learning" is the new big trend in Machine Learning. It promises general, powerful, and fast machine learning, moving us one step closer to AI.</p>
<p>An algorithm is deep if the input is passed through several non-linearities before being output. Most modern learning algorithms (including decision trees and SVMs and naive bayes) are "shallow".</p>
<p>For intuition, imagine if I told you that your main routine can call subroutines, and your subroutines could call subsubroutines, but you couldn't have any more abstraction than that. You can't have subsubsubroutines in your "shallow" program. You could compute whatever you wanted in a "shallow" program, but your code would involve a lot of duplicated code and would not be as compact as it should be. Similarly, a shallow machine learning architecture would involve a lot of duplication of effort to express things that a deep architecture could more compactly. The point being, a deep architecture can more gracefully reuse previous computations.</p>
<p>Deep learning is motivated by intuition, theoretical arguments from circuit theory, empirical results, and current knowledge of neuroscience. Here is a video where I give a high-level talk on deep learning, and describe this intuition: http://bilconference.com/videos/...</p>
<p>Here is more detailed information about deep learning: http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/</p>
<h1>Reasons not to use deep learning</h1>
<ul>
<li>simpler models tend to be easier to interpret (e.g. gradient boosted trees). When bad result comes, you may want to where does the problem come from.
e.g. model, features, training data or some other reasons?</li>
